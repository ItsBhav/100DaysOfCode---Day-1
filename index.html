    <p>
      Sushant Singh Rajput (21 January 1986 – 14 June 2020) was an Indian actor
      who is best known for his work in Hindi cinema. <br />
      Apart from acting and running a technological startup, Rajput was actively
      involved in helping young students. He was also the co-founder of an AI
      and technology company and a charity based company for social work.

    <h4>Early Life</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Maldiha in the Purnia district of
      Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh. One of his sisters,
      Mitu Singh, is a state-level cricketer. His mother's death in
      2002 left Rajput devastated and it was in the same year that the
      family moved from Patna to Delhi. Rajput attended St. Karen's High
      School in Patna and Kulachi Hansraj Model School in New Delhi.
      According to Rajput, he had ranked seventh in the DCE Entrance Exam in
      2003, and secured admission in the Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical
      Engineering) class in Delhi College of Engineering. He was also a
      National Olympiad Winner in Physics. In all, he cleared as many as 11
      engineering entrance exams, including that for the Indian School of
      Mines. After he started participating in theatre and dance, he rarely
      had time for studies, resulting in several backlogs which ultimately made
      him leave DCE. He completed only three years of the four-year course
      before dropping out to pursue an acting career. While a student at
      Delhi Technological University, Rajput enrolled in Shiamak Davar's dance
      classes. It was only later that the idea of making a career in acting
      came to him, as some of his fellow students in the dance classes happened
      to be interested in acting and was attending Barry John's drama classes.
      Influenced by them, Rajput also joined the acting classes. Here, he found
      his passion for acting: "I found the experience liberating. I realised
      that I could communicate with the audience. I knew I wanted to do this
      forever."Within a few months of joining the dance class, Rajput was
      selected to be a member of Davar's standard dance troupe. In 2005, he was
      chosen to be one of the groups of background dancers at the 51st Filmfare
      Awards. In 2006, he was part of the troupe that went to Australia to
      perform in the cultural programme at the opening ceremony of the 2006
      Commonwealth Games. By this time, he was tired of engineering. He was
      happy and successful in the dance and drama classes and decided to do what
      he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself
      full-time to dancing and acting. To make a break into films, Rajput
      moved to Mumbai and joined Nadira Babbar's Ekjute theatre group, which he
      remained a part of for two and a half years. During this time, he was
      featured in a TV advertisement for Nestlé Munch, which became famous
      throughout India.
